        <p>The Sharingan ( literally meaning: Copy Wheel Eye, meaning (Viz): Mirror Wheel Eye) is the dōjutsu kekkei
            genkai of the Uchiha clan that appears selectively among its members.It is regarded as one of the "Three
            Great Dōjutsu", the others being the Byakugan and the Rinnegan. While its powers originated from Kaguya
            Ōtsutsuki's Rinne , its independent form was first manifested by Indra Ōtsutsuki(Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki
            in the anime)</p>

            <p>Itachi Uchiha (Uchiha Itachi) was a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uchiha clan who served as an Anbu Captain.
                He later became an international criminal after murdering his entire clan, sparing only his younger
                brother, Sasuke. He afterwards joined the international criminal organisation known as Akatsuki, whose
                activity brought him into frequent conflict with Konoha and its ninja — including Sasuke who sought to
                avenge their clan by killing Itachi. Following his death, Itachi's motives were revealed to be more
                complicated than they seemed and that his actions were only ever in the interest of his brother and
                village, making him remain a loyal shinobi of Konohagakure to the very end.</p>
